# WOFF

This is a copy of the original implementation of the WOFF font
packaging format, provided for historical interest since the
copy hosted on people.mozilla.org is no longer online.

The code here has not been maintained or updated since September
2009, and should be assumed to have flaws and vulnerabilities.

The draft copy of the WOFF spec included here is likewise offered
for historical interest; it is superseded by the official W3C spec
at https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF/.
